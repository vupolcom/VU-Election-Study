# Social media followers of Dutch candidates to the 2021 Election


**People increasingly consume news and learn about politics on social media.**  A recent [Pew Research Report](https://www.journalism.org/2021/01/12/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-in-2020/) shows that 38% of the U.S. population get their news from Facebook (still the platform with the most active users in the country), 15% from Twitter, and 11% consume news from Instagram. A [2020 Digital News Report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf) from Reuters shows a similar scenario for the Netherlands. Whereas the Dutch population consuming news on TV has decreased from 80 to 67% in the last 5 years, in 2020 77% consume their news online (including social medial): 28% from Facebook, 9% from Instagram, and 7% from Twitter. Although these are not yet very large numbers, there is a clear trend. This means that political candidates running for elections need to gradually increase their social media presence and audience in order to be successful at influencing and mobilizing voters. 

In this report we provide **descriptive data about the <ins>Facebook</ins>, <ins>Twitter</ins> and <ins>Instagram</ins> followers** of these 13 candidates running to the 2021 Dutch Election:
  * Mark Rutte (VVD)
  * Farid Azarkan (DENK)
  * Thierry Baudet (FvD)
  * Jesse Klaver (GL)
  * Lilian Marijnissen (SP)
  * Esther Ouwehand (PvdD)
  * Gert-Jan Segers (CU)
  * Kees van der Staaij (SGP)
  * Sigird Kaag (D66)
  * Liane den Haan (50PLUS)
  * Wopke Hoekstra (CDA)
  * Lilianne Ploumen (PvdA)
  * Geert Wilders (PVV)

In particular, we touch on:
  * **How many followers do each candidate have in each platform?** We learn about the size of each candidates' audience in these platforms (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram), gaining insides about the amount of people to which they can easily communicate their message, and potentially mobilize to turn out to vote for their party in March. 
  * **What proportion of the followers do they share?** We learn about which candidates have the most followers in common on Twitter, gaining insides on which candidates may be appealing to similar parts of the electoral, and so compete for similar (or even the same) electors.
  * **How many followers have they gained since the start of 2021?** We learn about who has "recruited" the most new followers in the last couple months on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, gaining insides on which candidate may be having a momentum and increasing public support.


## Number of Followers

#### Geert Wilders (PVV) is killing it.

He has the most followers of all candidates on Twitter (\~ 850.000), Facebook (\~ 430.000) and Instagram (\~ 170.000). According to the mentioned [2020 Digital News Report](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-06/DNR_2020_FINAL.pdf), 60% of the Dutch population uses Facebook, 32% Instagram and 14% Twitter, which roughly translates into 10, 5,5, and 2,5 million people respectively. If we put the two pieces of data together, we observe (methdological limitations aside) that about 10% of the users in these 3 social media platforms follow Geert Wilders. The leader of the PVV has become a social media _guru_ and these platforms allow him to easily communicate and spread their message to many.


#### The candidates of other extreme parties (FvD and GL) also have a large social media audience.

Extreme parties on the right and on the left are known for having a younger voter, and so their voters are probably more likely to be on social media and to use these platform to consume news and engage in politics. In line with this train of thought, we observe the leader of GroenLinks (Jesse Klaver) to be second place in terms of Twitter (\~275.000) and Facebook followers (\~ 130.000), and fourth on Instagram followers (\~ 70.000). The FvD leader, Thierry Baudet, is third on Twitter (\~ 245.000) and Facebook followers (\~ 95.000), and second on Instgram audience (\~ 120.000). 


#### All other candidates have a relatively small social media presence.

With the exception of Prime Minister Mark Rutte (VVD), the rest of the party leaders running in this election have substantially small social media audience, less than 90.000 followers in each platform. The candidate with the least number of followers is Liane den Haan (50+), with only about 3.000 followers on Twitter, 2.000 on Facebook, and 400 on Instagram. Although when compared to the average voter, the likely voters of this party are older and probably less likely to be on social media, [research](https://www.journalism.org/2021/01/12/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-in-2020/) shows high levels of social media usage even among those > 50 years. Hence, Liane den Haan, may be missing on a great opportunity to spread her word and support.

#### And the Oscar goes to... Twitter

Overall, we see Twitter to be the platform where these candidates have the most followers, with Facebook and Instagram taking second/third place depending on the candidate. This is to some extent puzzling, as Twitter is the one with the least Dutch users, 14% of the Dutch population compared to 60% and 32% for Facebook and Instagram. However, it is probably an indication that people are more likely to use Twitter for political engagement.

## Who Shares a Similar Audience on Twitter?

We used the Twitter API to collect (on Jan. 19, 2021) the list of followers of each of the 13 candidates. Then, for each possible pair of candidates, we checked the amount of users who follows both candidates. We report the findings in the figure below, which should be read as follows: _the percentages in each cell indicate the % of followers of the candidate on left, that also follows the candidate at the bottom_. The same type of analysis cannot be conducted with the data publicly available from Facebook and Instagram, so we had to stick to Twitter for this one. Here is what we learned.


#### There is a big overlap between the followers of GL and all the other parties

Jesse Klaver (GL) is the second candidate with the most Twitter followers (\~ 275.000). Interestingly, with the exception of Wilder's followers, we see > 20% of the followers of all other candidates to also follow Klaver. The numbers go up to > 40% for the followers of the leaders of FvD, SGP, CU, CDA, D66, DENK, PvdD, and SP. These numbers indicate that the GL has a diverse pool supporters who have links and attachements to many other Dutch parties.
