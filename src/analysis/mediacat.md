# Use types

We categorize users according to their most used source, normalized with
respect to how often each source is used on average. Users that use
mostly social media, messaging apps or search engines to find news are
categorized as ‘Social Media Users’ (🐦). Users that mostly rely on
(print) newspapers or radio are classified as ‘Traditional Media Users’
(📰), while users that mostly use online news sites or news apps are
classified as ‘online media users’ (📱). Users that mostly use television
are classified as TV users (📺). Finally, users that use each media type
less than average are seen as news avoiders (🚫).
