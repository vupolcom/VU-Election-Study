From 1994 the research group Political Communication of the Vrije Universiteit has analysed the Dutch parliamentary election campaigns.
This site (which is mostly in Dutch) gives a rolling report of our findings of the 2021 elections.
For this, we combine a representative panel survey of 2.400 adult Dutch respondents with a systematic quantitative content analysis of the media content.
Using linkage analaysis, we can analyse whether consumption of specific media contents can predict shifts in attitudes,
including vote intention and trust in media and democracy.

For results, see our [Data reports](reports/index.md) (mostly in English)
